# Gemini Project Summary: Kids Keyboard

This document provides a summary of the "Kids Keyboard" project for the Gemini AI assistant.

## Project Overview

**Kids Keyboard** is a progressive educational typing tutor designed for early childhood learning. It aims to teach typing skills to children, starting from pre-schoolers (ages 3-5) and advancing to elementary school-aged children. The project follows a multi-sensory, inclusive, and progressive learning approach.

## Core Features

- **Virtual Keyboard**: A clean, responsive, and accessible virtual keyboard.
- **Tutor Mode**: A unique mouse-hover-activated tutor mode for guided learning.
- **Progressive Learning**: The curriculum is designed to evolve with the child's age and skill level, from basic letter recognition to AI-powered personalized instruction.
- **Accessibility**: The keyboard is designed with accessibility in mind, including ARIA support and sign language integration.
- **Developer-Friendly**: The project requires no build step, uses BEM CSS architecture, and has comprehensive TypeScript support.

## Development Roadmap

The project has a phased development roadmap:

1.  **Phase 1: Pre-School Foundation (Ages 3-5)**: Focuses on basic audio feedback, key information display, and animal/object associations.
2.  **Phase 2: Kindergarten Skills (Ages 5-6)**: Introduces finger positioning guides and sign language integration.
3.  **Phase 3: Elementary Skills (Ages 6-8)**: Implements simple word building and touch-typing fundamentals.
4.  **Phase 4: AI-Powered Learning (Ages 8+)**: Plans for voice conversation, adaptive instruction, and advanced analytics.

## Current Status (v0.9.0)

- The core keyboard functionality is stable.
- BEM CSS architecture and a clean HTML output are implemented.
